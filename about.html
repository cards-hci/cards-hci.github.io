										<h2>Lloyd May (Co-investigator and External Research Collaborator)</h2>
										<p><a href="https://www.lloydmay.net/">Lloyd May</a> (he/him) is a PhD candidate in music technology at Stanford University and a [TITLE] at Oberlin. Lloyd’s research focuses on the interaction media-interaction technologies and Disabled joy. Lloyd’s current work includes democratizing tools for haptic/vibration music generation, developing open-source tools for cochlear implant users to personalize their music listening experience, as well as a novel format for closed-captioning that would afford additional user customization. In his spare time, Lloyd co-runs <a href="https://paranoidpanda.net/">Paranoid Panda</a>, an indie game studio, and enjoys mosh pits and crocheting. </p>
